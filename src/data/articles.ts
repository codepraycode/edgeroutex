        title: "Towards edge-based data lake architecture for intelligent transportation system",
        description: "Fernandes et al created an innovative edge-based data architecture with a scalable, efficient solution for dealing with the diverse data demands of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling more effective decision-making, enhanced operational efficiency, and new services to cater to a smart and interconnected transportation environment. Shortcoming of this planned edge-based data lake design was that it did not address some challenges such as diversified information unification, tech incompatibility and common disconnections of vehicles.",

        description: "Konda looked into the effective integration of Edge Computing and AI. We look at the technological framework list the advantages and disadvantages and present experimental results from prototype implementations. Our goal is to offer a framework that is effective scalable and resilient enough for use in actual urban environments.",

        description: "Peyman et al (2021) summarize the state of the art of IoT in ITS, identify challenges posed by cloud, fog, and edge computing in ITS, and propose a methodology grounded in agile optimization algorithms for addressing a DRSP under an edge or fog computing environment. Generalizability and scalability to other modes of transportation is the constraint for this project.",

        title: "Edge Computing for Real-Time Near-Crash Detection for Smart Transportation Applications",
        description: "Ke et al developed a real-time edge-enabled system for identifying near-crash incidents. Large video files no longer need to be uploaded to a central server saving bandwidth and improving response times. The systems accuracy is over 90% as demonstrated by tests conducted on Chinese public buses. The study did not examine the systems stability across bus models of different sizes or in areas with different infrastructure conditions and it is costly to compute. Nevertheless, the deployment necessitated a significant investment to upgrade its hardware.",

        title: "Troubleshooting Common Edge Issues",
        description: "Experiencing slow response times or device sync errors? You're not alone. From network latency to hardware misconfigurations, even small glitches can impact your edge computing performance. In this guide, we break down the most frequent issues users face â€” and the quick fixes that can get you back on track in minutes...",
